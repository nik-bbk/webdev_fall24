# PORTFOLIO SITE - NIKKI BABCOCK
## Overview

### Four pages:
1. Welcome/about/index/homepage - COMPLETE
2. Portfolio - COMPLETE
3. Resume - PENDING
4. Writing - PENDING

## Challenges (+Solutions):
- I ended up spending a lot of time on several functions that did not make the final: 
scrolling marquee, mouse trail effects, overlay background. Though these did not pan out, I learned a lot about possiblities for the future.
- I wanted to implement side scrolling small details to add visual dynamism, but realized it would be less resource-intensive to just fake simulations using gifs. Ultimately I really like the result.
- POSITIONING: CSS really wants things to be aligned! I probably spent the most time here, figuring out how to organize my elements in aligned sections, and then deliberately un-align them.

## Favorite Features:
- Subtle nav text color animation. Implemented CSS keyframes for this, seems like a really awesome function and I plan to use it again in more places.
- Cursor Easter Egg: Both default cursor and link pointer cursor are taken from the in-game cursor in a League of Legends match. I was worried it's a bit incongruous with the overall aesthetic, but it's also a detail that sparks a lot of joy in me, so I think I'll keep it.

## Next Steps:
- Fix mobile responsive style! Obviously not the final verson: need to remove more elements/adjust positioning on an individual basis.
- Make nav section draggable (because I think it would be fun) and collapsable (necessary to make more space for portfolio). (**Actually, I think it would be cool to make all the 'pop-up' elements be draggable)
- Properly finish the portfolio section: fix grid spacing, add hover effects, realign nav, add actual projects.
- Style a resume page, or link to pdf: have to decide.
